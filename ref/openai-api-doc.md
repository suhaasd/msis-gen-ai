### The response object
https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/object


### Response Output
An array of content items generated by the model.

- The length and order of items in the output array is dependent on the model's response.

- Rather than accessing the first item in the output array and assuming it's an assistant message with the content generated by the model, you might consider using the output_text property where supported in SDKs.
