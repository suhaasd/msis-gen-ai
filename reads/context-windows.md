### Introducing Contextual Retrieval
- https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/contextual-retrieval
- For an AI model to be useful in specific contexts, it often needs access to background knowledge. For example, customer support chatbots need knowledge about the specific business they're being used for, and legal analyst bots need to know about a vast array of past cases.

## Context Windows

### Claude Docs - Understanding the context window
- https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows

- The “context window” refers to the entirety of the amount of text a language model can look back on and reference when generating new text plus the new text it generates. This is different from the large corpus of data the language model was trained on, and instead represents a “working memory” for the model. A larger context window allows the model to understand and respond to more complex and lengthy prompts, while a smaller context window may limit the model’s ability to handle longer prompts or maintain coherence over extended conversations.


### Building with Extended Thinking
- https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking
- Extended thinking gives Claude enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks, while providing varying levels of transparency into its step-by-step thought process before it delivers its final answer.
- When extended thinking is turned on, Claude creates thinking content blocks where it outputs its internal reasoning. Claude incorporates insights from this reasoning before crafting a final response.


### Extended thinking tips
- This guide provides advanced strategies and techniques for getting the most out of Claude’s extended thinking features. Extended thinking allows Claude to work through complex problems step-by-step, improving performance on difficult tasks.
